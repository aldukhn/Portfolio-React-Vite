# Portfolio-React-Vite

This is a portfolio website built with React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase Realtime Database. It features light and dark mode support.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have those installed, you can run the following commands:


- install `node_modules` using `pnpm i`
- start the website:
`pnpm dev`
-  Note: If you want to use `yarn` or `npm` just delete **pnpm-lock.yaml** file and install `node_modules` using `yarn add` or `npm i` 

This will start the development server on port 3000. You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.
